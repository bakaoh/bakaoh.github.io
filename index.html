  Today i won 1st place for the first time in a tournament. It&rsquo;s just a Novice tournament and the prize is only 1000 DEC, but i&rsquo;m still very happy with that. I have gone through 19 difficult battles with lots of luck.

  What is Idle games? Idle games, or &ldquo;games that play themselves&rdquo;, are games which are all about management of revenue streams. The core idea of these games is that progress can be made without a player&rsquo;s constant involvement. Player mainly focus on growth decisions.
These games are dominating many of the popular flash portals and shooting up the charts on mobile.
You earn in-game currency and buy upgrades. After that, you can put the game away and just check it once in a while; your purchased upgrades will earn money for you.

  Players don&rsquo;t like bots because they register as many accounts as possible in the off chance that they might end up getting a prize in high level tournament just by pure luck.
Splinterlands team tried to fix that problem by adding an entry fee in an update 2 months ago. But it seems ineffective. In fact, the solution even has a negative impact. Less real players willing to pay that fee giving the bots more chance to get prizes.

  I started playing splinterlands 3 months ago and slowly built up my deck. With mostly silver cards, i seldom reach Gold I.
After 3 seasons trying to reach Diamond using my own deck without success, I decided to create a new account, go to https://peakmonsters.com/ and rent a Gold deck to play the last 2 days of the previous season.
This deck costs me around $20 for 30-60 days, i can use them next 2-4 seasons.

  In the previous Gitcoin hackathon, i took part in a Matic challenge to Enable A Set Of Decentralized Protocols On The Matic Network. That&rsquo;s a good chance to get a better look at these well-known protocols.
These are the problems i encounter when working on the challenge:
 Uniswap uses Vyper which i&rsquo;m not familiar with. KyberSwap contracts uses many different Solc version. 0x has two major versions. bZx is dependent on 0x (both version) and Kyber addresses.

  After winning the first place in this, i was really excited to see what comes next Gitcoin hackathon.
Looking thought the challenge list, there&rsquo;s one that catch my eye: Create A New SDK Or Development Tool Facilitating Integration Of Keycard
The reasons are:
 It comes from status-im, i always learn so much from their codebase (and 10% of my portfolio is in SNT). I never worked with Smartcard/Javacard or NFC before.

  I bought my first Bitcoin two years ago when it was around $3000 and has keep trading everyday since then. I love trading, it&rsquo;s exciting to wake up in the morning and check my balance.
Everything is not going well, i burned out my account several times and never learned a thing. I&rsquo;m still having fun while trading but it&rsquo;s like an expensive hobby but not a business&hellip;
It&rsquo;s time to get serious.
