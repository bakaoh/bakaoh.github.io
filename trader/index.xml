      <description>I bought my first Bitcoin two years ago when it was around $3000 and has keep trading everyday since then. I love trading, it&amp;rsquo;s exciting to wake up in the morning and check my balance.
Everything is not going well, i burned out my account several times and never learned a thing. I&amp;rsquo;m still having fun while trading but it&amp;rsquo;s like an expensive hobby but not a business&amp;hellip;
It&amp;rsquo;s time to get serious.</description>
