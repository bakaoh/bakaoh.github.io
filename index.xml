      <description>What is Idle games? Idle games, or &amp;ldquo;games that play themselves&amp;rdquo;, are games which are all about management of revenue streams. The core idea of these games is that progress can be made without a player&amp;rsquo;s constant involvement. Player mainly focus on growth decisions.
These games are dominating many of the popular flash portals and shooting up the charts on mobile.
You earn in-game currency and buy upgrades. After that, you can put the game away and just check it once in a while; your purchased upgrades will earn money for you.</description>

      <title>Solutions for low level bots in tournament</title>

      <description>Players don&amp;rsquo;t like bots because they register as many accounts as possible in the off chance that they might end up getting a prize in high level tournament just by pure luck.
Splinterlands team tried to fix that problem by adding an entry fee in an update 2 months ago. But it seems ineffective. In fact, the solution even has a negative impact. Less real players willing to pay that fee giving the bots more chance to get prizes.</description>

      <description>I started playing splinterlands 3 months ago and slowly built up my deck. With mostly silver cards, i seldom reach Gold I.
After 3 seasons trying to reach Diamond using my own deck without success, I decided to create a new account, go to https://peakmonsters.com/ and rent a Gold deck to play the last 2 days of the previous season.
This deck costs me around $20 for 30-60 days, i can use them next 2-4 seasons.</description>

      <description>In the previous Gitcoin hackathon, i took part in a Matic challenge to Enable A Set Of Decentralized Protocols On The Matic Network. That&amp;rsquo;s a good chance to get a better look at these well-known protocols.
These are the problems i encounter when working on the challenge:
 Uniswap uses Vyper which i&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with. KyberSwap contracts uses many different Solc version. 0x has two major versions. bZx is dependent on 0x (both version) and Kyber addresses.</description>

      <description>After winning the first place in this, i was really excited to see what comes next Gitcoin hackathon.
Looking thought the challenge list, there&amp;rsquo;s one that catch my eye: Create A New SDK Or Development Tool Facilitating Integration Of Keycard
The reasons are:
 It comes from status-im, i always learn so much from their codebase (and 10% of my portfolio is in SNT). I never worked with Smartcard/Javacard or NFC before.</description>

      <description>I bought my first Bitcoin two years ago when it was around $3000 and has keep trading everyday since then. I love trading, it&amp;rsquo;s exciting to wake up in the morning and check my balance.
Everything is not going well, i burned out my account several times and never learned a thing. I&amp;rsquo;m still having fun while trading but it&amp;rsquo;s like an expensive hobby but not a business&amp;hellip;
It&amp;rsquo;s time to get serious.</description>
