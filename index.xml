      <description>After winning the first place in this, i was really excited to see what comes next Gitcoin hackathon.
Looking thought the challenge list, there&amp;rsquo;s one that catch my eye: Create A New SDK Or Development Tool Facilitating Integration Of Keycard
The reasons are:
 It comes from status-im, i always learn so much from their codebase (and 10% of my portfolio is in SNT). I never worked with Smartcard/Javacard or NFC before.</description>

      <description>I bought my first Bitcoin two years ago when it was around $3000 and has keep trading everyday since then. I love trading, it&amp;rsquo;s exciting to wake up in the morning and check my balance.
Everything is not going well, i burned out my account several times and never learned a thing. I&amp;rsquo;m still having fun while trading but it&amp;rsquo;s like an expensive hobby but not a business&amp;hellip;
It&amp;rsquo;s time to get serious.</description>
