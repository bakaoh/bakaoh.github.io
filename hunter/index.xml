      <description>In the previous Gitcoin hackathon, i took part in a Matic challenge to Enable A Set Of Decentralized Protocols On The Matic Network. That&amp;rsquo;s a good chance to get a better look at these well-known protocols.
These are the problems i encounter when working on the challenge:
 Uniswap uses Vyper which i&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with. KyberSwap contracts uses many different Solc version. 0x has two major versions. bZx is dependent on 0x (both version) and Kyber addresses.</description>

      <description>After winning the first place in this, i was really excited to see what comes next Gitcoin hackathon.
Looking thought the challenge list, there&amp;rsquo;s one that catch my eye: Create A New SDK Or Development Tool Facilitating Integration Of Keycard
The reasons are:
 It comes from status-im, i always learn so much from their codebase (and 10% of my portfolio is in SNT). I never worked with Smartcard/Javacard or NFC before.</description>
